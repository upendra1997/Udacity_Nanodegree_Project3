    "**Answer:** I used sequence length of 60, because I thought 10 sentences (average length of sentences is 6) will be enough to know the context of conversation and would be able to have all the information required for making a proper response. I used 32 as my batch size as I thought higher batch size will add unnecessary noise and I am already using a dropout of 50% which was more than enough. I tried various learning rate and 0.0001, seem to show proper decrese in loss. vocab_size and output_size was set to length of our dictionary which contain all the words, so that we can find the probability of word from dictionary which will occur next. I selected 100 as embedding dimension as it should be enough for 46367 words in dictionary. I used 512 as hidden dimension for a single GRU layer and I used 2 GRU layers with 50% dropout so that it can hold many parameters and find intersting patterns which will be useful for predicting next word. I tried other combinations of hidden_dim and n_layers but they were showing higher loss."
